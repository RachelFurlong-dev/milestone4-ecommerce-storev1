Montserrat is the font family used across the website with open-sans & sans-serif as a fall-back font.   
Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Argentine graphic designer Julieta Ulanovsky and released in 2011. It was inspired by posters, signs and painted windows from the first half of the twentieth century, seen in the historic Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Montserrat is a free and open source font available via Google Fonts.
## Images:
The homepage hero image will be used in the new website to aid customer recognition of the brand. Curent product images will be carried accross to the new site.

# Wireframes:
All my wireframes have been created in Adobe XD. You can see my wireframes in the folder [here](/wireframes)

# Categories update:
- The previous website, due to its age and a number of people adding products meant that categories have expanded and some are not used any more. The new website will streamline the categories to reflect the current product offering. The new categories will be accessible to the customer on the home page via a series of drop down menus, so products can be easily found.
